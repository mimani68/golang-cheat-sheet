# Deadlock

Deadlock happens in Go when two or more goroutines are waiting for each other to complete an action, resulting in a permanent blocking state where none of the goroutines can proceed. This can happen, for example, when two goroutines are trying to acquire the same resources in different orders, causing them to block each other.

To understand how deadlock can happen in Go, let's consider the following scenario. Suppose we have two goroutines, A and B, and two channels, C1 and C2. Goroutine A is trying to read from C1 and write to C2, while goroutine B is trying to read from C2 and write to C1. If both goroutines try to read from the channels before writing to them, a deadlock can occur, as both of them will be blocked, waiting for the other to complete the write operation.

To avoid deadlock in Go, you should ensure that your code does not create circular dependencies or race conditions, and always use non-blocking operations whenever possible. Additionally, tools like `go vet` and `go run -race` can help you detect potential race conditions and deadlocks in your codebase.

## Memory address vs Channel

Golang channels and memory addresses serve different purposes in Go programming:

* Channels facilitate communication and synchronization between goroutines by allowing them to share data through a FIFO queue-like mechanism 

* Memory addresses, on the other hand, enable direct access and modification of data by storing the location in memory where the data is stored

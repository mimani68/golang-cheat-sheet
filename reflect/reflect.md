### Advanced Golang Interview Question:

**Question:**
How do you implement reflection in Go to inspect and manipulate types and values at runtime, and what are some use cases for this feature?

### Answer:

Reflection in Go allows you to inspect and manipulate types and values at runtime. This is achieved using the `reflect` package. Hereâ€™s how you can implement it and some common use cases:

#### Using the `reflect` Package

The `reflect` package provides functions to inspect the type and value of any Go value, and to manipulate those values.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    p := Person{Name: "John", Age: 30}

    // Get the type of the value
    t := reflect.TypeOf(p)
    fmt.Println("Type:", t)

    // Get the value of the value
    v := reflect.ValueOf(p)
    fmt.Println("Value:", v)

    // Inspect and manipulate fields
    for i := 0; i < t.NumField(); i++ {
        field := t.Field(i)
        fieldValue := v.Field(i)
        fmt.Printf("Field %s: %v\n", field.Name, fieldValue.Interface())
    }

    // Modify a field value
    v.Field(0).SetString("Jane")
    v.Field(1).SetInt(31)

    // Print the modified struct
    fmt.Println("Modified Person:", p)
}
```

#### Use Cases

1. **Dynamic Configuration**:
   - You can use reflection to dynamically set configuration values based on user input or configuration files.

2. **Serialization and Deserialization**:
   - Reflection is useful when implementing JSON or XML serialization and deserialization, as it allows you to dynamically inspect and set fields of a struct.

3. **Validation**:
   - You can write validation functions that use reflection to check the values of struct fields against certain rules or constraints.

4. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**:
   - In database interactions, reflection can be used to map database rows to struct fields dynamically.

### Example Output

When you run the above code, it will output something like this:

```
Type: main.Person
Value: {John 30}
Field Name: John
Field Age: 30
Modified Person: {Jane 31}
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `reflect` package to inspect the type and value of a struct, and how to dynamically modify its fields at runtime. However, it's important to note that reflection should be used sparingly due to its performance overhead[1][4][5].

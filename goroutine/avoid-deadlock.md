## Key Points:

### Use Buffered Channels:
Buffered channels can help prevent deadlocks by allowing producers to send data even if the consumers are not immediately ready to receive it.

### Separate Producers and Consumers:
Ensure that producers and consumers run in separate goroutines to avoid blocking each other.

### Use WaitGroups:
Use sync.WaitGroup to ensure that the main goroutine waits for all producers and consumers to finish before exiting.

### Close the Channel:
Close the channel when all producers have finished sending data to signal to the consumers that no more data will be sent.
